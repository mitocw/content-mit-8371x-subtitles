Let us now begin the story of quantum error correction,
first, with some history, and then with the bit flip code.
As of 1995, it was widely believed
that quantum error correction was impossible because
of three main reasons.
First, states collapse when measured.
This is very different from classical.
Second, errors are continuous in the quantum realm rather than
digital bit flips.
Third, quantum states must obey the no-cloning theorem, thus,
an unknown quantum state cannot be copied,
and there is no direct analog of the classical redundancy code.
Quantum error correction today is known to get around these,
first, by not measuring the state holding the quantum
information, but rather, only measuring
the effect of the environment.
This is a little counterintuitive
For the second and third objections,
one orthogonalizes errors using entanglement.
This is a subtle idea.
And we will see it in practice by looking at some examples.
Specifically, let us consider the three qubit
code for bit flip errors.
The bit flip error channel is defined
by this quantum operation.
With probability 1, minus p, The input once unchanged.
And, with probability p, the density matrix input
sees an x error.
So, that is x row x.
x dagger is the same as x.
This is known as the bit flip channel.
Schematically, we think of this as a communication
between Alice and Bob over a noisy channel
represented by E of rho, the operator-sum representation
given here.
For quantum error correction, we define an analog
to classical codes by saying that a n, k quantum code C
is a k-qubit subspace of an n-cubit Hilbert space.
Notice that we do not define the notion of distance yet.
That will come later, when it is easier to do.
An example is given by the n equal 3,
k equal 1 code with these code words,
where 0 is 000 and 1 is 111.
This is to be compared versus the naive encoding, which
would take an unknown qubit, a0 plus b1,
and replace that with three copies of the unknown qubit.
It is impossible to do this, in general,
due to the no-cloning theorem.
So, let us return to this bit flip channel.
Again, here's the operator-sum representation
of the noisy channel.
Let the input state be an arbitrary, encoded qubit.
So, this is a logical 0 plus b logical 1.
When each of the qubits goes through this bit flip channel,
acting independently and identically, we
may receive, with probability 1 minus p cubed,
the same as the original state.
Or, a single bit flip might happen
to the first qubit, or the second qubit,
or the third qubit, each case happening with probability p
times 1 minus p squared.
Or, two bit flip errors might happen.
This happens with probability p squared times 1 minus p
and may happen to two out of the three qubits involved.
Finally, all three qubits may experience a bit flip error,
and this happens with probability p cubed.
The four bottom cases here are those cases with an error.
The four cases at the top are all states
which are mutually orthogonal and thus, in principle,
can be distinguished.
Thus, in principle, error correction
should be possible by projecting onto
these orthogonal subspaces.
And that is how quantum error correction
works, as we will see next.
