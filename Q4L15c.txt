We now show that a simple version of quantum bit
commitment, known as clean quantum bit commitment,
is insecure.
This includes one round and non-orthogonal states,
so a slight generalization of what we just saw.
Just as in the very simplest protocol,
A chooses her secret b and two states, which
produce what she sends to Bob.
First is psi AB0, which is a superposition
over an orthogonal set of states on A and another set of states
phi to send to Bob.
We also have psi AB1 for the case when B is equal to 1.
The ei and ej prime states are orthogonal to each other
and play the role of A tilde in randomizing
what is sent to Bob.
The states phi i and phi j prime are non-orthogonal potentially
and are the states sent to Bob.
This mapping of classical parameters to states
is public and plays the role of the one-way function.
In this first step of the commit phase,
A measures her first register, the ei and ej prime,
obtaining i or j.
In the second step, Alice commits
by sending Bob the state psi, which is either phi i or phi j
prime.
These two steps may be illustrated
as a quantum circuit.
Alice first performs a measurement
on half of the states.
That's the ei, ej part.
And then Bob potentially performs a unitary transform
on what he receives from Alice.
This is the boundary between Alice and Bob,
and later we will see why Bob's unitary transform is
meaningful to include.
In the opening phase, Alice provides b, her secret,
as well as i or j, the index on to the state sent to Bob.
Bob then verifies in the fourth step
by checking to see whether Alice's previous sent
state, phi i or phi prime j, agrees
with the state created by B, i, and j, that is, the state psi.
For this protocol to be secure, we
needed to have the desired properties
of hiding and binding.
For hiding, we need Bob's density matrix rho sub
B to be the same and independent of Alice's secret b.
To be binding, the protocol must be such that Alice cannot
change her secret b after the commit phase.
I now claim that this protocol cannot be simultaneously hiding
and binding.
In other words, it is insecure.
Historically, this result from Dominic Mayers, HF Chau,
and Hoi-Kwong Lo was a milestone in our understanding of quantum
bit commitment and quantum particles
utilizing entanglement.
The proof of this no-go theorem utilizes our familiar friend,
the Schmidt decomposition.
The bipartite state, psi AB, has a Schmidt decomposition
involving e sub k, which is already orthogonal,
and f sub k, which is orthonormal by virtue
of the decomposition.
Thus we may rewrite psi AB0 as a sum over Schmidt coefficients
lambda sub k, ek, and fk orthonormal
and psi sub AB1 similarly with ek prime and fk prime.
How are fk and fk prime related?
It turns out that hiding places a strong requirement on fk
and fk prime.
The density matrix when Alice's secret b is equal to 0
is given by this partial trace over A's state.
Writing this in terms of the Schmidt decomposition
and recognizing that e sub k is a complete set of states
gives us a matrix diagonal in the f sub k basis.
When we do the same for rho sub B1,
we find that it is the same expression
but with f sub k prime and lambda sub k prime.
These two density matrices must be the same.
And thus lambda equals lambda prime and f
equals f prime for all k.
Let's use this equality and Schmidt decomposition
to rewrite our two states.
Psi AB0 is thus the Schmidt coefficients with ek and fk,
and psi 1 is the same state with ek prime and fk.
Because of the requirements of hiding,
the Schmidt coefficients and the state sent to Bob are the same.
Is this protocol then binding?
Now consider a unitary transform, which maps e sub k
to e sub k prime.
This acts on the qubits that Alice keeps locally to herself.
U sub A is thus something Alice can choose
to do without telling Bob.
And in fact, this let's Alice change
psi AB0 to psi AB1 and vice versa.
And again, Alice this does this without touching Bob's state.
Therefore, we conclude that this protocol
violates the second requirement, namely that of binding.
Alice can cheat in her commitment
without Bob being able to detect the cheating.
In fact, this cheating is a straightforward generalization
of the EPR attack we saw on the simple protocol.
Can the clean quantum bit commitment protocol
be fixed, perhaps by adding multiple rounds
or some other kind of generalization?
It turns out not to be possible.
No generalization of this protocol
is known to be secure today.
