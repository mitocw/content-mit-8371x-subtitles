The quantum analog of the noiseless coding theorem
was worked out by Ben Schumacher.
In this scenario, the source sends
quantum states and the output is characterized by density matrix
rho.
In comparison with a classical scenario,
the symbols, instead of letters, are quantum states
which may be non-orthogonal and the distribution, instead
of a PDF, is a density matrix.
The message is a tensor product of, say,
end symbols from the alphabet.
The quantum noiseless coding theorem states
that messages from a quantum source of von Neuman
entropy s of rho can be faithfully transmitted
over a noiseless channel at a rate
s of rho qubits per symbol.
And this is, again, asymptotically in the limit
of large n.
Please appreciate that this theorem actually
defines, from a resource standpoint, what
it means to be a quantum bit.
This endows the concept of a qubit
with an operational meaning.
Let us look at a quick example.
Suppose that the alphabet has the states 0 and 0 plus 1
divided by root 2.
Each is admitted with probability 1/2.
The density matrix is thus the combination
of these two states, which gives us, overall,
the density matrix 1/4, 3111.
Let's look at the eigenstates of rho.
Later, I'll tell you why.
One eigenstate-- call it zero bar-- is cosine pi/8 times
0 plus sine pi/8 1.
And the other is orthogonal with minus sine pi/8 0
and cosine pi/8 1.
The zero state has an eigenvalue given by this expression.
By virtue of their orthonormality,
any block of n qubits-- call it phi--
may be represented as a linear combination of tensor
products of these eigenstates.
Zero bar one bar thus behavior kind of like classical bits.
Note also that these symbols of our alphabet
have particularly large overlap with the zero bar state.
That is, the squared matrix element of psi 0 and psi 1
with zero bar are both cosine squared pi over 8, around 0.85.
This is a high overlap.
In contrast, the matrix element with one bar is relatively low.
That is, sine squared of pi/8, around 0.15.
This high overlap, low overlap distinction
shows up vividly when we look at block coding the n
equals 3 case.
Let us denote any 3 qubit combination of the letter
states psi 0 and psi 1 as the state phi.
Note, then, that phi has a very large overlap with triple zero
bar, namely cosine pi/8 cubed, around 0.62.
The overlap with states with one one
bar is slightly lower, at 0.107, and increasing
the number of one bar states lowers
this overlap even further.
For example, with two one bar states,
we get an overlap matrix element of 0.018.
And with three one bar elements, the overlap drops to 0.003.
The terms with the most zero bar elements
thus has the highest weight.
And in fact, there are three possible cases with 1 1.
And thus, in total, there are four high probability cases
and we may encode these as two qubits.
In the limit of large n, throwing away
the low probability cases does not decrease the fidelity
meaningfully.
To understand how this all works,
we must turn to the asymptotic case.
This is captured with two definitions and two theorems.
First, we define a string of symbols-- x1 through xn--
as being epsilon typical.
If the combinatorial probability is bounded below
by 2 to the minus 1 times h of x plus epsilon
and bounded above by 2 to the minus
n times h of x minus epsilon.
Alternatively, the criteria may be
expressed by saying that the average negative log
probability of the string of symbols
must be within epsilon of h of x, where h of x
is the entropy of x.
This definition is meaningful, because of the theorem
of typical sequences.
The theorem holds that for any fixed positive epsilon
and any delta greater than 0, for sufficiently large message
block size n, the probability that a message is
epsilon typical is at least 1 minus delta.
This means that asymptotically, most messages are typical.
And in fact, the number of atypical messages
drops exponentially.
The quantum case has an analogous definition.
For a source described by density matrix rho
with orthonormal unraveling end states
x and epsilon typical subspace is defined
as being the subspace spanned by the vectors labeled
by epsilon typical sequences of x.
Note that these probabilities are the eigenvalues of rho
and the quantum states are those with labels
given by the classical symbols.
In analogy to these typical sequences theorem,
we have a theorem about typical subspaces for the quantum case.
For fixed positive epsilon, then for any delta greater
than 0 for sufficiently large block
size n, the overlap between the epsilon typical subspace
and the n symbol quantum state is at least 1 minus delta.
Here, p of n epsilon denotes the projector
into the typical subspace-- namely,
the tensor product of all epsilon typical message states.
Note that I have simplified some of the steps
and logic for presentation.
Please refer to the textbook for the details of the proofs.
Schumacher compression, the methodology
behind quantum noiseless coding, works
because of the typical subspaces theorem.
We begin with n log d qubits from the message source.
We then compress this to n s of rho qubits.
And finally, we may decompress this back
to obtain the original n log d qubits to good approximation.
The compression scheme utilizes two steps.
First, we apply a unitary transform
to rotate each cube it into the eigenbases of the density
matrix of the source.
This provides a basis with probabilities
with classical interpretations.
Thus, we may then project into the typical subspace defined
by the typical sequences of the label eigenvectors.
The decompression step undoes all of the compression
simply by reversing the steps of the compression scheme.
This works because asymptotically, the projector
only leaves behind an infinitesimal subspace which
is atypical.
