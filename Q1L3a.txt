Before examining full quantum error correction,
let us look at a simpler case.
First, that of quantum error detection.
We may examine this using the operator-sum representation.
Consider the action of a quantum operation defined by operation
elements E sub K, not on a whole Hilbert space,
but rather on a subspace C. We may visualize
the action of the quantum operation
on this subspace by looking at transformations given
by each one of the operation elements E. Let C
be this orthogonal subspace of the Hilbert space.
One of the error operators, such as U0,
might be a unitary operation that rotates this subspace,
as we can denote here in a cartoon way as a rotation of C.
That is, it is a unitary transform.

Another operation element, E1, might
be a projector, which takes C to a number or a much
smaller subspace.
Yet another operation element, say, E2,
might be one of the operation elements,
such as we saw in phase damping, which shrinks or deforms
this subspace C in a non-uniform way.
I have drawn these here as if they were all
separate subspaces.
But, in general, the output of the operation elements
may be spaces which overlap or collide with each other.
For quantum error detection, given a set of errors E sub k,
the important thing is that, on this subspace C,
the output of the operation elements
must be distinguishable.
And that is true under certain circumstances.
Specifically, the image of C must
be a disjoint set of vector spaces for all operation
elements in the set.
This allows us to perform error detection
and create an error detection code.
Here's a simple example on a 2-qubit space.
Let us define C as a linear vector space spanned by the two
vector basis states, 00+11 and 01+10.
In this expression, a and b are arbitrary coefficients
for the state psi.
And that defines C. Note that a squared plus b squared
equals 1, so that psi is a unit vector.
The errors of interest are described
by phase damping happening independently
and identically to the 2 qubits.
We will include a subset of the possible errors.
Specifically, we have, for a single qubit, the phase
damping operator's identity and sigma
Z weighted by probabilities alpha and 1 minus alpha,
respectively.
For 2 qubits, the error operators
are given by the tensor product of the single qubit error
operators.
Thus, we have, for E00, alpha identity.
For E01, we have square root of alpha times 1
minus alpha times IZ.
And, similarly, for E10, we'll have ZI,
and then for E11, we will have ZZ.
Actually, though, do we really want
to include the ZZ operation?
Let us leave it out for now, because it
will turn out that this error is not distinguishable.
And, therefore, we do not want to include it
in our error detection set.
So, now, let us see what the action is
of these error operators on the codewords of our space.
The first error operator, E00, is identity,
and, therefore, it's easy to see that it leaves
the code space unchanged.
That happens with probability alpha squared,
since there are 2 qubits.
For E01, we have the error operation IZ.
Recall that our code words is defined by the basis states,
00+11 and 01+10.
We, therefore, see that IZ flips the sign of terms which
have a 1 in the second qubit.
Therefore, we have this output state,
and we make it a density matrix.
Similarly E10 flips this sign when
the first qubit on the left is a 1 versus being a 0.
The reason that this is interesting
is because, these two code spaces, the images of E acting
on C, are orthogonal to C. That it
can be seen by looking at these two particular vectors.
They are both orthogonal to C. The two vectors
are, though, not orthogonal to each other.
Therefore, we cannot distinguish which error happened.
That is, if it was E01 or E10, but we can detect the fact
that an error did occur.
So, therefore, this is not error correction,
but it shows the principles of how errors can be detected.
