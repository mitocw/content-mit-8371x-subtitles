A quick example of typical sequences
is particularly effective in illustrating
the central role of entropy.
Consider an iid binary source which
produces zero or one with probability p and 1 minus p.
For example, if p is 0.854 and 1 minus p, 0.146, then out
of n bits, we expect approximately np zeros.
When n is 1,000, that means 854 zeros and 146 ones.
How many of these binary strings would have to np zeros?
Well that's just n choose np.
And we expand this using the normal combinatorial formula.
But it is far more insightful to see
what this is asymptotically by applying
Stirling's approximation.
Let us take the log of the combinatorial expression.
Substituting in Stirling's approximation,
we find an expression where a bunch of terms cancel,
namely the constant terms here.
And we may identify additional cancellations
by rewriting some of these logs of products as sums of logs.
So we find terms with log n and log p and log 1 minus p.
The log n terms all cancel, leaving us
with this expression, minus np log p minus n minus np
log 1 minus p.
Factoring the n out front, we find this is nothing
more than n times H of p.
This final expression is remarkably useful.
n choose np is approximately 2 to n H of p.
In our particular example, for n equal 1,000, log of n
choose np is 595.
And the approximate version, n times H of p, is 600.
This approximation illustrates the power
of thinking about typical sequences in terms
