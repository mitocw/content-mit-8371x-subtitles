The quantum bit flip code is created
from the classical triple redundancy code.
This concept can be generalized to allow
quantum codes to be built from a wide variety
of classical codes.
And that idea is behind what is known as the CSS codes concept.
For example, take the 3 bit code,
repeat it three times, giving the short 9 qubit
code, as shown here.
Why does this work, in terms of the quantum error
correction criteria?
Well, each set of 3 qubits essentially has a triple
redundancy coat that is 000 and 111 as the code words.
And, thus, for a single bit flip errors, x sub j,
we have that the error correction criteria gives us
an orthogonality between the bit flip errors.
Thus, the criteria are automatically
satisfied for bit flip errors.
Single bit flip errors.
How about for phase flip errors though?
Phase flip errors are Zed errors.
And do we have that Zed j Zed k are orthogonal?
Now, to see why this works, recall
that x conjugated by the Hadamard gate
gives the Zed gate.
Thus, what we want-- PZZP, may be rewritten as P
with x's conjugated by H. And this, we
desire to be orthogonal.
Now, if we apply another H on the outside of all of this,
we get this expression here.
And we may recognize that H conjugating P gives rise
to this change of bases which goes
from 0 to the plus state and 1 to the minus state.
Thus, each acting on the logical 0 logical 1,
give us these superpositions of plus and minus states.
These code words in the plus and minus bases, again,
are instances of the 3 bit redundancy code.
The action of the x bit flip operator,
though, takes plus to plus and minus to minus
of the minus state.
Thus, in a sense, this superposition--
recalling that plus and minus add up to zero-- of plus, plus,
plus and minus, minus, minus is kind of like a 000 code word.
And, similarly, logical 1 is like a 111.
That is, in terms of signs.
Therefore, this triple redundancy code property
lets us conclude, by observation,
that the quantum error correction
criteria are satisfied for phase flip errors.
Thus, by virtue of two classical code instances--
the triple redundancy code acting twice-- we
have the 9 qubit code, which corrects both phase flip
errors and bit flip errors.
The 9 qubit code, again, does this
by using the 3 bit code twice, one time embedded
or concatenated within the other instance.
This idea maybe generalized, taking one classical code
to correct for bit flip errors and concatenating
a second classical code to correct for phase flip errors.
The idea is called the CSS codes approach,
invented by Rob Calderbank, Peter Shor, and Andrew Steane.
The first class of quantum codes,
which generalized to a large set of families instead
of single instances, the basic construction
involves two classical codes-- C2,
which corrects for phase flip errors,
and C1, which corrects for bit flip errors.
C2 is a subset of C1, and, actually,
the code use for phase lifts is C2 perp.
This may be visualized in terms of a set diagram.
Imagine that we have a set of code words C1.
C2 is a subset of C1, but see?
Two also asks cosets.
These cosets are other copies or instances of C2 within C1.
And we will later see how this gives rise to a quantum
