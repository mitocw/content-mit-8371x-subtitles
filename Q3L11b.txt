An important tool in quantum simulation
is the Lie product formula, also known as Trotterization.
The goal is to simulate a certain Hamiltonian and H
sys, which we assume is the sum of a number
of local Hamiltonian terms, H sub k.
Such structure is very common, for example,
in the Ising model.
We have a sum over spin spin interactions, each of which
is local, sigma dot sigma.
One may try to simulate such a Hamiltonian,
for example, by simply simulating
each one of the Hamiltonians and then taking the product.
However, this product of local evolutions
is certainly not equal to the desired overall system
evolution because the individual Hamiltonian terms typically
do not commute with each other.
To approximately construct H sys from Hk,
we use the Lie or Trotter-Suzuki theorem.
Let A and B be two operators which are Hermitian.
Then, for a real valued parameter t,
which will represent time, we have
that in the limit of having an infinite number of steps,
where each step is an infinitesimal evolution by A
then by B, and this then repeated, we get evolution
under the sum of A and B for time t.
For this to hold, in fact, A and B do not need to commute.
That is an important part of this theorem.
We now prove the theorem as follows.
Let us expand each time step operator as a power series
to leading order in 1 over n.
The product of two of these time steps
is thus then to leading order a evolution by A plus B.
But this is just two time steps.
Now let us combine n of these times steps
together by taking this to the nth power.
We may apply the binomial theorem to this
to get an expression which has n choose k and A plus B
to the kth power divided by n to the k.
As an aside, let us compute n choose k divided by n to the k.
Expanding the combinatorial functions as factorials,
we may identify where n to the k appears
in both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel.
This leads us to leading order simply 1 over k factorial.
Now employing this in our binomial expansion,
we find is that we are left with A plus B to the kth,
divided by k factorial, up to order 1 over n.
We are thus left with e to the A plus B in the limit
of n approaching infinity.
This proves the theorem.
The actual application of the Lie product formula
is interesting to observe in some examples.
Let A and B two Hamiltonians and evolution be for time delta t.
To leading order we have just two of these terms,
and that gives us an expression good to order t squared.
A big improvement comes from using just three time
slices, where the first is A for time delta t divided by 2.
The second is B, for time delta t.
And the third is A, again, for time delta t divided by 2.
This is an order delta t cubed approximation.
Note the symmetry in this expression.
It is this which gives the ever cancellation.
This second example illustrates how this idea of symmetry
can be extended to a Hamiltonian with l terms.
We then approximate the time evolution
by half time steps of, say, Hl to H2, followed
by a full time step at H1.
And then another set of half time steps of H2 to through Hl.
This approximation expression has a sandwich-type structure.
And it is good to order tau squared.
What is neat is that this symmetry
can continue to be exploited to get a higher order
approximation.
u4 here is constructed from the u2 expressions
that we just saw, but evolve for different amounts of time.
Evolved first for two a tau periods,
then for a 1 minus 4a tau period.
And then two more a tau periods.
For the right choice of a, here, in particular, a being 1 over 4
minus the cube root of 4, we find
this is a good approximation to order tau to the fourth.
This may be generalized in an almost recursive manner.
And it leads to methodologies known as symplectic integrators
and is in general called Trotterization
in the art of quantum simulation.
