Perhaps the most important practical application
of quantum information has been cryptography.
And as a famous cryptographer has written,
the notion of commitment is at the heart
of almost all non-trivial cryptographic protocols.
Consider a scenario with two participants--
A, who we will call the commiter, and B,
who we will call the verifier.
We wish A to commit to a secret.
She does this in two phases.
In phase one, known as the commit phase,
there are two steps.
First, A chooses her secret as 0, from an alphabet S. Second,
A publishes some information which is related to S,
namely f of S 0.
We'll call this f 0.
In phase two, the opening phase, there are also two steps.
First, A reveals S 0, the secret.
And then, fourth, B does something.
B verifies that f 0, which was given previously,
is equal to f of S 0, which was just given.
It is important that f is a publicly known function.
In fact, this f must be a non-invertible function
known as a one-way function.
Otherwise B could determine S 0 from f 0.
After all, B knows F 0.
For this to be a good commitment protocol
two properties must hold.
First, it must be hiding, that is,
that B cannot be able to determine S 0 from f 0.
Second, it must be binding.
A must not be able to change her mind about S 0
after committing in phase one.
So what have we accomplished by having a protocol
with these two properties?
For example, an old fashioned realization of bit commitment
is to write down the secret S 0.
0 or 1 on a piece of paper and then put this piece of paper
in a safe.
This safe, with its locked door, serves the purpose
of the one-way function.
To open, A gives the combination to B, who retrieves
the secret stored in the safe.
Another example shows how bit commitment
is done in a more modern way.
A chooses two primes, p and q.
These prime numbers may be large unusual ones,
such that A may release the product N equal p times q,
but p and q remain hard to find.
Thus, in the opening phase, A reveals p,
and B may check that p is a factor which divides N.
This version of the protocol is good only so long
as factoring is a hard problem.
A secure bit commitment scheme is
useful for a variety of applications
such as the millionaires problem, where
two millionaires went to find out
who has more money without revealing
how much either one has.
Bit commitment may also be used for certain, secured two-party
computations.
But can bit commitment be realized securely
without the need for computational complexity
assumptions?
Let us see if bit commitment can be realized with quantum
