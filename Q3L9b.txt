Let us look at a quick example of factoring by order finding.
Choose N to be 3 times 5, the number 15.
Suppose we chose at random x being
7, 7 being a number which is coprime with 15.
Our goal is to find a nontrivial value of r, the order of 7
with respect to 15 that is such that x to the r mod n equals 1.
Let us do this by tabulating the values of r and seven
to the r mod 15.
For r equal 0 we find 1.
For r equal 1 we find 7.
For r equal 2 we find that 7 squared 49 modulo 15 is 4.
Now, to compute the case for r equal 3, we multiply 4 by 7
to get 28 modulo 15 gives us 13.
to get 28 modulo 15 gives us 13.
Repeating this pattern, multiplying 13 by 7
gives us 91, which, modulo 15 is 1.
This is the first value of 1 that
we find.
And because this is 1, the pattern
continues to repeat as r gets larger.
That is, we get 7, 4, and 13.
The first value
of r for which the exponentiation is 1
gives us r equal 4.
So 4 is the order of 7 with respect to 15.
Plugging this into the formula for the rest of the reduction
theorem gives us 7 to the r divided by 2 modulo 15 being 4.
Thus, computing the greatest common divisor between 4
plus or minus 1 and 15 gives us 3 and 5, the factors of 15.
Isn't that neat?
