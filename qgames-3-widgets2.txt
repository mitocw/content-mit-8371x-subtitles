For this payoff matrix, it turns out
there is no dominant strategy.
However, there is something suggestive of an interesting
strategy, because there is a local maximum at the $1.00,
$1.00 price point.
At this local maximum point, neither party
has an incentive to change their price.
This concept of a local maximum is an important one
in game theory.
It is a Nash equilibrium.
A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies,
one for each player, such that no player has incentive
to change his or her action.
In many ways, a Nash equilibrium is a self-enforcing agreement.
We can thus recognize, in this game, the $1.00,
$1.00 price point as a Nash equilibrium.
