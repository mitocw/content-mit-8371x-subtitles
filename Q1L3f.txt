One of the earliest results in quantum error correction,
and a great surprise at the time of its discovery,
is Shor's 9-qubit quantum error correction code.
Here are the code words for that code,
logical zero is a nine qubit state which is 0, 0, 0, plus 1,
1, 1 repeated three times.
Logical one is the state 0, 0, 0 minus 1,
1, 1, repeated three times, normalized.
The amazing thing about this code
is that the code can correct for arbitrary single qubit error.

Let us see how this works by examining the syndrome
operators for this code.
Again these are the quantum operators
used to measure the bits that determine
the location and the kind of error that occurred.
For the bit flip errors, the 9-qubit code
employs syndrome operators like this, zed one zed two,
and zed two zed three.
We can see how these work by writing out
the code words explicitly, logical zero like this
and logical one like this.
I've written out all nine qubits here,
and zed one zed two acts on the first two qubits
in the first triplet.
Zed two zed three act on the second two qubits.
Of course it works both on the 0, 0, 0 and the 1, 1, 1 pair,
but I'm only indicating the first three here directly.
Bit flip errors may also happen to the second triplet,
and those are detected by using zed four zed five,
and zed five zed six as the parity check operators.
These are just like the bit flip code,
and so we have zed seven zed eight,
zed eight zed nine for the third triplet,
so this is like three copies of a three qubit code.
The parity check operators check the pairs
of all the possible qubits in each one
of these triplets for errors.
So why are there three copies?
That becomes evident when we look at the phase
flip syndrome operators, which are x one through x six,
and x four through x nine.
These two operate on the first pair
of triplets, that's for the first operator
and the second pair of triplets, that's for the second phase
flip operator.
And the reason they work is evident
if you look at the signs and parity of the signs.
Shown here marked in green, we
find we have plus, plus, plus and minus, minus, minus.
So this is a parity flip code.
The 9-qubit code thus concatenates a bit flip code
and a phase flip code together.
How well does it perform compared with what is possible?
Well let us look at some metrics of performance of quantum error
correction codes.
The number of possible errors on these nine qubits
is 1 plus 3 times 9.
1 indicates identity, that is no error,
and there are three possible errors, X, Y,
and Z on each qubit, and there are nine qubits.
Thus there are 28 possible errors that may occur.
That's a single qubit errors.
Now let us look at the syndrome operators
and how many errors might be distinguishable in principle
by the number of possible syndrome measurement results.
There are six bit flip checking operators,
and there are two phase flip checking error syndromes,
thus we have two the eight possible syndrome values.
0 or 1 for each, meaning 256 distinguishable errors,
and this is to be compared with the 28 possible single qubit
errors.
Thus in fact, this nine qubit code
can correct many errors beyond single qubit errors.
And in fact some of those are two qubit errors.
The nine qubit code is interesting for many reasons
and we will return to it later.
How good can a quantum error correction code be?
We define a perfect quantum code with parameters n and k
as being one where the number of possible syndrome measurement
results is exactly the number of possible single qubit
errors on the system.
That is, the code has log base 2 of 1
plus 3n syndrome operators.
Is there such a perfect quantum code?
Yes, it turns out to be that five qubits can
encode one qubit perfectly.
This code has 1 plus 3 times 5, namely 16, possible errors,
and it employs four syndrome operators.
The four syndromes can distinguish 16 possible errors,
that is 2 to the 4, and thus the number
of distinguishable errors exactly
equals the number of possible single qubit errors. Thus, the five-qubit code is perfect.
