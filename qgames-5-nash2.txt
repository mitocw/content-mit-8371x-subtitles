Consider what happens if the players start with the DL
strategy.
From this point, it is clear that the LR player can
gain a higher payoff by switching from L to R.
Similarly, the up-down player can also gain a higher payoff
by switching from down to up.
In addition, if we had started from the up-right strategy
both up and down could also switch strategies
to either up-left or down-right to gain a higher payoff.
Thus, we see that both up-left and down-right
are Nash equilibria.
That is, this game has two Nash equilibria.
