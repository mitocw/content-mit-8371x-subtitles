Let us apply the quantum Fourier transform
to solving an interesting problem-- phase estimation.
The scenario is that we are given a unitary transform, u,
and an eigenstate state of u-- little u, such
that u's eigenstate is e to the 2 pi i phi--
And the problem is to find phi.
Now, we don't know how to do this efficiently using
just what I've given here.
However, if the terms of the problem
are changed such that instead of just u,
you are given a controlled u of a form which
I'll specify in just a moment, then
it turns out we can find phi efficiently.
Now, this Problem Two version can
be solved with the following algorithm-- the phase
estimation algorithm.
We have two registers of qubits, one with t qubits
that start in zero and go through Hadamard.
A second, which is the u state that we are given that has n
qubits.
We perform a controlled u operation,
and then an inverse quantum Fourier transform.
And I'll show how this measurement of this register
produces the desired result to good approximation.
And of course, the bottom register
will just get a phase shift.
The measured result is phi times 2 to the t, an integer.
Actually, it won't be exactly phi times 2 to the t,
but the claim will be that this will
be the result with high probability
and under certain cases.
What I most want to demonstrate is the ideal case working,
and thus I will begin with some assumptions which
we will be able to generalize beyond later.
The strongest of these assumptions
is that phi will be exactly t bits long.
That is, it is described by finite binary fraction
with just spaced phi one through phi t.
OK.
Let's take this quantum circuit and walk
through why it works based on our understanding
of the quantum Fourier transform.
Here is the circuit.
Note that the effect of the controlled u
is to change the power exponentially of u that
is applied.
u, and then u squared, u to the fourth, u to the eighth,
and so on.
We have t qubits in this control register,
and we have n qubits in this data register.
All I've shown so far is this first part of the circuit,
and it's very much like an operator measurement circuit.
The controlled u to the k acting on 0 plus 1 and u
gives zero plus omega to the k phi times 1 with u.
This first part is a single qubit
which gains a phase, just like we saw in the operator
measurement circuit.
That phase gives the eigenvalue of u.
In contrast with a poly-operator measurement case though,
here eigenvalues can be different from just
plus and minus one.
For controlled u to the one, we get the usual result-- omega
to the phi, acting on one.
For u squared we get omega to the two phi times cat 1.
For u to the fourth, we get omega
to the four phi times cat 1, and so forth to the case
where we have u to the 2 the t, giving us omega to the 2
to the t times phi times cat 1.
This state should be very familiar to you
from the Fourier transform analysis.
We may rewrite the bottom qubit as omega to the zero point
phi 1 through phi t.
Remember, phi is a binary fraction.
The second qubit has omega to the zero point phi 2
to phi t times 1.
The third qubit has omega to the zero point phi three phi
t times 1, and so forth up to the final qubit
up at the top, which has omega to the zero point fee t
times 1.
This is, in fact, exactly the output of the quantum Fourier
transform, and thus we may rewrite it straightforwardly
as simply the [INAUDIBLE], which is a sum over omega phi times
k times cat k.
This state, fed backwards through the inverse quantum
Fourier transform, thus gives us phi-- or, more accurately,
phi times 2 to the t.
And recall, this is the output of the quantum Fourier
transform showing up here in this circuit.
This output is the ideal case.
In reality, phi will not be t bits exactly,
so we get an approximation.
Second, we need this eigenstate u,
which may not be available in general.
And third, the scenario has called
for a controlled u-- in fact, controlled powers of u--
to exponentially higher values, and this is not
generally possible given a u.
Nevertheless, this phase estimation algorithm
does turn out to be quite useful,
